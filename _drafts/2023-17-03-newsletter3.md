Welcome to the (belated) February issue of the STAND newsletter. We're delighted to be able to introduce to two new members of staff to the project team.

### Melissa
I'm a Conservation Scientist at RSPBâ€™s Centre for Conservation Science. My role in the STAND project is to lead on the national and landscape scenario modelling, and the consequences of which on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, food production and others. My background is in climate change ecology, and I completed a PhD at the University of York (with Natural England and NatureScot) on the impacts of climate change on an upland butterfly, the Mountain Ringlet. I'm very interested in the consequences of climate and land-use change in the uplands, and the importance of nature-based solutions in addressing the climate crises.
