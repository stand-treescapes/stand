Alix, Sue and Sheena from the STAND team visited Elan Valley, Wales, on the 13th of July to gain a 
deeper understanding of the history, character and current activities taking place within the Valley, one 
of our case study landscapes. Our team met up with the local RSPB Conservation Officer and the Reserve 
Warden at RSPB Carganfallt for a tour of the landscape and a discussion on the current management, 
habitat types, challenges and opportunities for future land use change. The main habitats of the valley 
include blanket bogs, moorland, waterways and the woodland. At this location the woodland is referred 
to as an ‘Atlantic woodland’ because of the wetness of the environment it almost imitates the Amazon 
Rainforest. The area is designated an Important Plant Area with plant species such as bog rosemary, 
cotton grasses, heather and bog mosses. The area is also designated Sight of Special Scientific Interest to 
support upland bird assemblage, peregrine falcon and merlin, red kites, with the wider landscape also 
providing key habitat for curlew's, dunlin and golden plover.

Elan Valley has a deep history that dates back to around 4,000 years ago. The people and landscape of 
Elan Valley have been heavily shaped by the large dams and reservoirs built between the late 19th to 
mid-20th century. The wider Elenydd is deeply rooted in traditional upland sheep farming and remains 
one of mid-Wales most inaccessible and wild landscapes. 

The team will be returning in September for workshops with local stakeholders where we will discuss
with local communities their values and future land use preferences. When creating future land use 
scenarios, it’s important to get local input and knowledge from the people who work and live within the 
landscape.
