## WP1: embedding local ambition in the national context
* Simulate and evaluate 1000s of future scenarios of UK land-use, combining different amounts of treescape expansion alongside other measures
* Predict impacts on AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) GHG emissions, food production and bird populations
* Develop a web-app for participants to identify scenarios which achieve user-defined targets
* Identify land-use implications of high-performing scenarios for our 2 case study landscapes

## WP2: co-producing landscape-scale scenarios of treescape expansion
* Understand the interests, goals and preferences of stakeholders
* Co-design scenarios of landscape-scale treescape expansion using Participatory Scenario Planning in our 2 case study landscapes
* Evaluate impacts on AFOLU GHG emissions, food production and bird populations, using WP1 modelling
* Understand how different actors at different nested scales can work in synergy to deliver positive change

## WP3: inter-disciplinary synthesis
* Co-produce local Treescape Expansion Action Plan for each case study landscape
* Assess whether co-produced landscape-scale scenarios (bottom-up) achieve ambition implied by national scenarios (top-down)
* Prepare best-practice guidance to facilitate future application of our interdisciplinary, participatory, cross-scale methodology
