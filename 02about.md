## Project summary 
The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy. However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.
