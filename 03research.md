## Project summary

* The expansion of woodlands and treescapes presents a potential solution to the climate and nature crises, and forms a core part of the UK Government's [Net Zero Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy).
* But decision makers need to know how the form, location & configuration of treescape expansion influences social and environmental costs and benefits.
* National policies and targets rarely map neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). 
* **Top-down** approaches to treescape expansion risk alienating local actors…
* …whilst **bottom-up** approaches may fall short of ambition needed to address global challenges.
* STAND will address this 'scale mismatch' which, we argue, creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. 
* We will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.

## Case study landscapes
Our case study landscapes exemplify the challenges and opportunities of treescape expansion. **Elenydd-Mallaen** in mid-Wales overlaps the Special Protection Area (SPA) of the same name, whilst the **North Pennines & Dales** in northern England occupies the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and most of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.
