# STAND 
STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/) project, starting in late 2022. STAND is a collaboration between the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/), [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences) and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/).

The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy. However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescapes can achieve the best outcomes for people and nature. 

STAND will ask how landscape-scale treescape expansion can be designed and governed across scales to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.
