# STAND 
STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/) project, starting in late 2022.

The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy. However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescapes can achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.
