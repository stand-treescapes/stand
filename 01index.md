## Scenarios of Treescape Expansion for People and Nature
STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/){:target="_blank"} project, led by the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/) in collaboration with [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences){:target="_blank"} and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/){:target="_blank"}.

## Project summary
* The expansion of woodlands and treescapes presents a potential solution to the climate and nature crises, and forms a core part of the UK Government's [Net Zero Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy).
* But decision makers need to know how the form, location & configuration of treescape expansion influences social and environmental costs and benefits.

* National policies and targets rarely map neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). 
* **Top-down** approaches to treescape expansion risk alienating local actors…
* …whilst **bottom-up** approaches may fall short of ambition needed to address global challenges.
* STAND will address this 'scale mismatch' which, we argue, creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. 
* We will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.

## Case study landscapes
Our case study landscapes exemplify the challenges and opportunities of treescape expansion. **Elenydd-Mallaen** in mid-Wales overlaps the Special Protection Area (SPA) of the same name, whilst the **North Pennines & Dales** in northern England occupies the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and most of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.
