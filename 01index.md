STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/){:target="_blank"} project, led by the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/) in collaboration with [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences){:target="_blank"} and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/){:target="_blank"}.

## Project summary 
The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy. However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.

## Case study landscapes
Our case study landscapes exemplify the societal and ecological challenges and opportunities of treescape expansion. Elenydd-Mallaen in mid-Wales overlaps the SPA of the same name, whilst the North Pennines & Dales in northern England occupies the North Pennines AONB and most of the Yorkshire Dales NP. Both landscapes are primarily upland in nature, but have contrasting incumbent land uses and devolved policy contexts. Current woodland cover stands at 4% in Elenydd-Mallaen and 8% in North Pennines & Dales, and in both cases is dominated by non-native coniferous plantations.
