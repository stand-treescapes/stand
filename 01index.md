## Scenarios of Treescape Expansion for People and Nature
STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/){:target="_blank"} project, led by the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/) in collaboration with [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences){:target="_blank"} and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/){:target="_blank"}.

## Project summary 
* The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's [Net Zero Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy).
* However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes).
* This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. 
* STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.

## Case study landscapes
Our case study landscapes exemplify the challenges and opportunities of treescape expansion. **Elenydd-Mallaen** in mid-Wales overlaps the Special Protection Area (SPA) of the same name, whilst the **North Pennines & Dales** in northern England occupies the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and most of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.
