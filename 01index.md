## Scenarios of Treescape Expansion for People and Nature
*STAND* is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/){:target="_blank"} project, led by the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/) in collaboration with [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences){:target="_blank"} and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/){:target="_blank"}. *STAND* will ask how landscape-scale treescape expansion can be designed and governed across scales to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.
