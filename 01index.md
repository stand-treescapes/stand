STAND is a [*Future of UK Treescapes*](https://www.uktreescapes.org/){:target="_blank"} project, led by the [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/centre-for-conservation-science/) in collaboration with [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/social-sciences){:target="_blank"} and [UHI](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/forestry-and-conservation-group/){:target="_blank"}.

## Project summary 
The expansion of woodlands and treescapes forms a core part of the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy. However, national policy rarely maps neatly onto actions at lower spatial scales (e.g. farms and landscapes). This 'scale mismatch' creates a barrier to effective treescape expansion. STAND will combine national- and landscape-scale modelling with Participatory Scenario Planning to understand how future treescape expansion can be designed and governed to achieve the best outcomes for people and nature.
