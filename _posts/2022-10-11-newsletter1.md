We're delighted that *STAND* is among the successful projects recently announced through the latest round of the Treescapes programme. You can read more about the six successful Call 2 projects [here](https://www.ukri.org/news/research-will-support-the-expansion-of-treescapes-in-the-uk/){:target="_blank"}. I also posted a short [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomfinch89/status/1574334368591630337?s=20&t=KtAjW8W9oNwX5yhSHFW_8A){:target="_blank"} to briefly introduce *STAND*, and [this](https://community.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/b/science/posts/innovative-research-to-support-the-expansion-of-forests-in-the-uk){:target="_blank"} RSPB Science blog has some more details too (it also covers another Call 2 project, *DiversiTree*, which my colleague Paul Bellamy is involved in).

## What's in a name?
A few people have asked "why *STAND*?". This is a good question. *STAND* is roughly an acronym for **S**cenarios of **T**reescape Expansion for People **AND** Nature, though the full  title of our project is actually "Overcoming scale-mismatch for designing and governing treescape expansion to benefit people and nature" (try and turn that into a catchy acronym!). *STAND* is also intended to capture the notion of a 'stand' of trees, as well as stakeholders 'standing up' and having their voices heard. So there you go!

## Progress so far
* We have a [project website](https://stand-treescapes.github.io/){:target="_blank"}!
* We've assembled an Expert Advisory Group (see the [People](https://stand-treescapes.github.io/people/#expert-advisory-group) page) to provide technical and policy-related oversight to the project. 
* My colleague Andrew Weatherall introduced *STAND* at the recent [Future of UK Treescapes conference](https://www.uktreescapes.org/future-treescapes-22-the-more-we-learn-about-trees-the-more-there-is-to-learn/){:target="_blank"}. There's a recording [here](https://youtu.be/ksexVrBIncE?t=10235){:target="_blank"}.
* We'll shortly be advertising three exciting job opportunities, so watch this space.
