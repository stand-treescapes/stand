## Success!
We're delighted that *STAND* is among the successful projects announced through the second call of the Treescapes programme. You can read more about the six successful projects [here](https://www.ukri.org/news/research-will-support-the-expansion-of-treescapes-in-the-uk/){:target="_blank"}. I posted a short [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomfinch89/status/1574334368591630337?s=20&t=KtAjW8W9oNwX5yhSHFW_8A){:target="_blank"} to briefly introduce *STAND*, and [this] (https://community.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/b/science/posts/innovative-research-to-support-the-expansion-of-forests-in-the-uk){:target="_blank"} RSPB Science blog has some more details too (it also covers another Call 2 project, *DiversiTree*, which my colleague Paul Bellamy is involved in).

## What's in a name?
A few people have asked "why *STAND*?". This is a good question. *STAND* is roughly an acronym for **S**cenarios of **T**reescape expansion for people **AND** nature, though the full  title of our project is actually "Overcoming scale-mismatch for designing and governing treescape expansion to benefit people and nature" (try and turn that into a catchy acronym!). *STAND* is also intended to capture the notion of a 'stand' of trees, as well as stakeholders 'standing up' and having their voices heard. 

## Progress so far
* We have a project website!
* We've assembled an Expert Advisory Group (see the [People](https://t-finch.github.io/stand/people/) page) to provide technical and policy-related oversight to the project. 
* We'll shortly be advertising a few job opportunities, so watch this space.
* My collegue Andrew Weatheral introduced *STAND* at the recent Future of UK Treescapes conference
